## Welcome
Hi! I am a Software Engineering researcher and thus, excited to explore and share the richness of SE world. This page contains personal initiatives and pointers to resources to improve knownledge related to Software Development. As I am primarily working in Software Maintainence activities, hence the references may contain resources for source code analysis and program comprehension. So jump in and see if you may find a hidden gem. Let the good times roll!

### CodeAnalyzer

It is a static analysis tool, developed as an Eclipse Plugin, to assist developers identify code smells and suggest various refactorings. At present support for Extract Method Refactoring only is available. 
Tool can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/omkarendra/codeAnalyzer/blob/master/codeAnalyzer_1.0.0.202101201055.jar?raw=true), as a jar file. After downloading place it in the 'plugins' directory of your Eclipse and restart it (if already running). Once, restarted you should notice a new menu titled 'codeanalyzer' to menu bar. There you go.
